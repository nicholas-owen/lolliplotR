Description: This package creates elegand plots of variant information on gene/transcript layouts as well as peptide sequences. By configuring intron sizes to be cooerced to smaller representations, an intron/exon structure plot can be overlayed with variant information, either provided or downloaded from several sources.
    Using the package `trackviewer` information can be automatically obtained for Ensembl transcript/peptide coordinates and variants plotted in several creative ways.
    Blah blah.
